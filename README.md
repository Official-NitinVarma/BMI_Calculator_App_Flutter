# First Application created using Flutter

This is my first Application that I have created using Flutter.

## BMI Calculator
This application calculates your Body Mass Index and tell you how fit you are.
You can downlaod the .apk file using below link.

[Install the BMI application](https://github.com/Official-NitinVarma/week_one_application/blob/master/app-release.apk)

This is a raw application. The codes can contain useless comments and some images that were used to learn concepts and for trial purpose.
A Validator is used in AGE TEXTFIELD, that restrict you calculaing your BMI if your age is below 15
